## Multi VPC Template

This template builds upon the base infrastructure components and creates an environment as described in the 
[AWS Quickstart](https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-enterprise-accelerator-nist)
but has four VPCs defined (dev/test/stage/prod) in addition to the management VPC.
